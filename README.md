# Amusement Park Pass Generator

## iOS Techdegree Project 1

For this project, you’ll create a system for creating and validating access passes to an amusement park.
There are three types of people who can be granted access to the park: employees, vendors, and of course, guests.
As you can imagine, these different groups are allowed to enter different areas of the park, and may or may not be permitted to do certain things, like ride the rides or receive discounts in certain eateries and shops, for example.
Within each category of park access, there should be several sub-categories with varying access rights.
For example, guests can be “Classic”, “VIP”, or “Free Child”, with different privileges associated with each.
